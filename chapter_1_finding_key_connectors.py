# Exercise 1
# Create a dict where the keys are user ids and the values are lists of friend ids. 
# Output:
# {
#   0: [1, 2],
#   1: [0, 2, 3],
#   2: [0, 1, 3],
#   etc...
# }

for i, j in friendship_pairs:

# obtain the number of friends for a given person

    friends_ids = friendships[user_id]
    return len(friends_ids)


# Determine the total number of connections:
total_connections = sum(number_of_friends(user) for user in users)
print(total_connections)

# average number of connections
average_connections = total_connections / len(users)    

# Degree Centrality
# A simple count of the total number of connections linked to a vertex
# The degree centrality of a node is simply its degreeâ€”the number of edges it has. 

# create a list of tuples that have (user_id, number_of_friends)
num_friends_by_id = [(user["id"], number_of_friends(user)) for user in users]

# sort by most friends to least friends
num_friends_by_id.sort(key=lambda id_and_friends: id_and_friends[1], reverse=True)

# write a function that determines the count of friends of friends for a user
# do not count friends of friends that are already friends
# 
# output should be:
# { id_of_friend_of_friend: number_of_connections,
#   id_of_friend_of_friend: number_of_connectsion,
#   etc... }
